## Project Setup
Once the repository has been cloned, please change directories to the server folder on one terminal and on another terminal, please change directories to the frontend folder.

After changing directories on both terminals, please run `npm install` on both the server and frontend terminal. 

Once the command has been successfully completed, on the server terminal please run `npm start` and then enter `npm start` on the frontend terminal. Please ensure your latest version of Node is up to date. 

The application should now be running. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my code!

### Note:
If you experienced errors with executing the command `npm start` in the frontend due to old version of Node, please update to the latest version of Node. After updating, please run the command: `npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk` and then run `npm start`.
